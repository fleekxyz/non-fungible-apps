# NFA Extension (WIP - Testing Purposes)

This simple browser extension compares any active tab's URL against the NFA project's registry of domains. If there is a match, recommends the user to open the page via the direct IPNS/IPFS hash. Uses the default browser/metamask gateway to open the ipfs page, if the user accepts.
