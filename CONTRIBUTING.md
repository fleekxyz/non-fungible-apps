## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

1. Search for existing Issues and PRs related before creating your own;
2. Make sure you are being clear about your ideas and expose as much information as you can (e.g. code samples, images);
3. We will be working hard to handle and respond all Issues as soon as possible, but it can takes time for investigation root causes. Please be patient.

If you don't know where to start, you can take a look in the [Getting Started section on our wiki](https://github.com/fleekxyz/contracts/wiki/Getting-Started).

```

Please ensure your code is clear and readable and also provide as much information you can in the description.

> ⚠️ Your code and any changes made needs to be covered with tests

> ⚠️ In case of need, you have to provide all documentation changes within your PR

## Testing

We are up to write tests using both [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) frameworks. Its mandatory that all tests were well described and all validations to make the code consistent and secure. To get more information about it, check the [Testing section on our wiki](https://github.com/fleekxyz/contracts/wiki/Getting-Started#testing). You can also get some examples of how to test it on [test folder](/test).
