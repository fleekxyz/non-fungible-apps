## Testing

We are up to write tests using both [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) frameworks. Its mandatory that all tests were well described and all validations to make the code consistent and secure. To get more information about it, check the [Testing section on our wiki](https://github.com/fleekxyz/non-fungible-apps/wiki/%F0%9F%93%98-Getting-Started#testing). You can also get some examples of how to test it on [test folder](/test).
