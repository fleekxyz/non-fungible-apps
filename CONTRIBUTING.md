1. Search for existing related Issues and PRs before creating your own.
2. Make sure you are clear about your ideas and expose as much information as you can (e.g. code samples, images).
3. We will be working hard to respond to all Issues as soon as possible, but it can take time to investigate root causes. Please be patient.

## Testing

We are up to write tests using both [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) frameworks. Its mandatory that all tests were well described and all validations to make the code consistent and secure. To get more information about it, check the [Testing section on our wiki](https://github.com/fleekxyz/non-fungible-apps/wiki/%F0%9F%93%98-Getting-Started#testing). You can also get some examples of how to test it on [test folder](/test).
